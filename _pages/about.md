I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego. I am supervised by [Prof. Truong Q. Nguyen](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=48) at the [Video Processing Lab](http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu/). Before coming to UCSD, I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2018. My research interests include medical image processing, signal processing, and machine learning.
